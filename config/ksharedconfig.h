 * KConfig variant using shared memory
 *
 * KSharedConfig provides a shared (reference counted) variant
 * of KConfig.  This allows you to use manipulate the same configuration
 * files from different places in your code without worrying about
 * accidentally overwriting changes.
 *
 * The openConfig() method is threadsafe: every thread gets a separate repository
 * of shared KConfig objects. This means, however, that you'll be responsible for
 * synchronizing the instances of KConfig for the same filename between threads,
 * using reparseConfiguration after a manual change notification, just like you have
 * to do between processes.
